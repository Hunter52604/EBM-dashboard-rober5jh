Purpose

How to ask me to use the textbook

Notes & metadata
- I read the start of the file during this session and confirmed the table of contents and modules exist in the workspace file.
- The source file is large (~16k lines). When you ask me to pull from the textbook, specify either a module number/title or a short search phrase so I can extract the most relevant excerpt.
- I will always cite the module and approximate location (e.g., "Module 5, paragraph X") when quoting.

Next steps (optional)
- I can create a searchable JSON index of headings and keywords for faster programmatic lookup (small script). Say "yes" if you want that.
- Or ask me now to pull a specific module, section, or quote from the textbook and I'll extract and summarize it for you.
