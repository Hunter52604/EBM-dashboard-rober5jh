# Problem Definition Framework

## X → Y Framework

# Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)

- Engagement scores are below targets; several teams report low
	morale.
- Burnout
- Voluntary turnover
- Recognition and development are inconsistent.
- Feedback is irregular and many employees lack role autonomy.

### Desired State (Y - What outcome do we want to achieve?)

- Within 6–12 months: +5–10 points on engagement survey domains.
- 10–20% relative reduction in voluntary turnover in pilot teams.
- 5–15% improvement in productivity proxies.
- A repeatable, low-cost non-monetary program (recognition,
	autonomy, development, feedback) that managers and HR
	consistently apply.

## PICOC Framework

### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)

- Employees across roles where monetary raises or bonuses are
	constrained — e.g., frontline staff, knowledge workers, and
	mid-level managers in a mid-sized organization (50–500
	employees).
- Particular focus on teams with reported low engagement,
	rising voluntary turnover, or declining productivity metrics
	over the last 6–12 months.

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)

- A bundle of non-monetary motivators delivered over a 6–12
	month pilot.

	Elements include:

	- Formal recognition (peer and manager recognition systems).
	- Increased job autonomy via role/task redesign and
		decision authority.
	- Career-development supports: mentoring, microlearning
		stipends, and stretch assignments.
	- Improved feedback rhythms: regular 1:1s and actionable
		performance conversations.
	- Targeted workplace design changes: flexible scheduling and
		meaningful team rituals.

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)

- Status quo (no systematic non-monetary program).
- Traditional monetary-focused approach: raises, bonuses, or
	spot pay (if available).
- Single-component interventions (e.g., recognition only) to
	test which elements drive the biggest change.

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)

- Primary outcomes (measurable):

	- Employee engagement score increase (e.g., +5–10 points on
		an engagement survey domain) within 6 months.
	- Reduction in voluntary turnover rate (e.g., 10–20% relative
		decrease) over 12 months.
	- Improvement in productivity or output proxy (e.g., task
		completion rate, sales per rep, tickets closed) by 5–15%
		where applicable.

- Secondary outcomes (behavioral / perceptual):

	- Higher frequency of positive recognition events recorded
		(peer/manager recognitions per month).
	- Improved manager effectiveness ratings in employee
		surveys.
	- Increased participation in development activities
		(mentoring, training completion rates).

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)

- Mid-size organization (50–500 employees) in a hybrid or
	flexible work environment, North America.
	Pilot duration: 6–12 months with mixed cross-functional teams.
	Results will inform potential scale-up.

Assumptions:

- Budget constraints limit monetary incentives.
- Leadership is willing to pilot non-monetary interventions and
	collect outcome data.
- HR systems can track engagement, turnover, and training
	participation.

## Clear Problem Statement

Managers in our mid-size organization (≈50–500 employees) are
unable to use raises or bonuses due to current budget
constraints. As a result, several teams report low engagement and
voluntary turnover has increased over the last 6–12 months.
Productivity proxies have declined in affected teams. We need a
repeatable, low-cost program of non-monetary interventions
(recognition, autonomy, development, feedback, flexible
practices) that can be piloted and measured to restore
engagement, reduce turnover, and improve productivity within
6–12 months.

## Why This Problem Matters

### Impact on Organization

- Financial and operational costs: continued low engagement and
	elevated turnover increase recruiting and onboarding costs,
	reduce institutional knowledge, and lower productivity across
	teams.
- Performance risk: reduced productivity and uneven service/
	delivery quality can harm customer satisfaction and revenue
	generation.
- Talent pipeline risks: persistent low morale reduces internal
	promotion rates and weakens succession planning.

### Stakeholder Impact

- Employees: Lower job satisfaction, reduced motivation, and
	higher burnout risk; fewer professional development
	opportunities may slow skill growth and career progression.
- Managers: Increased time spent on hiring and reactive people
	management rather than strategic work; inconsistent team
	performance.
- HR and Leadership: Greater pressure on limited compensation
	budgets; difficulty meeting retention and diversity goals.
- Customers/Clients: Potential declines in service quality,
	responsiveness, or innovation if frontline and knowledge
	workers disengage.

### Strategic Alignment

- Retention & Talent Strategy: Aligns with organizational goals
	to retain high performers and reduce avoidable turnover
	within existing budget constraints.
- Operational Efficiency: Improving engagement and productivity
	supports delivery targets and cost-effective operations.
- Culture & Employer Brand: A structured, non-monetary program
	supports long-term culture goals (recognition, development,
	autonomy) that improve recruitment and employee value
	proposition.

Implementing a measurable, low-cost pilot directly supports
near-term operational goals while preserving fiscal
constraints and building evidence for scale-up.

## Evidence Questions to Explore

### For the Problem (Step 2)

- What evidence shows this problem exists?
- How widespread is this problem?
- What are the root causes?

Refined problem-level questions (measurable):

- What are the current engagement scores by team and domain,
	and how have they moved over the past 12 months?
- What is the voluntary turnover rate (12-month rolling) by
	department and role level, and what are the key drivers cited
	in exit interviews?
- Which job features (autonomy, task variety, recognition,
	development opportunities, feedback frequency) are most
	strongly correlated with engagement and intent-to-stay in our
	employee survey data?

### For the Solution (Step 4)

- What evidence supports our preferred solution?
- Has this solution worked in similar contexts?
- What are the potential risks and benefits?

Refined solution-level questions (evaluative):

- Which non-monetary interventions (peer/manager recognition,
	autonomy, structured feedback, targeted development, flexible
	scheduling) have produced meaningful, measurable improvements
	in engagement and turnover in mid-size organizations (50–500
	employees)?
- What effect sizes have been reported for engagement and
	turnover outcomes for single-component vs. bundled
	interventions?
- What implementation factors (manager training, frequency/
	timing, measurement cadence) moderate success and scalability?
- What are the common unintended consequences or risks
	(e.g., perceived unfairness, recognition fatigue, increased
	workload) and how have studies mitigated them?
